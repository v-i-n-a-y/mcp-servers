    # Sequential Thinking Process Guide
    
    This tool helps break down complex problems into manageable steps through a structured thinking process.
    
    ## How to Use
    
    1. Start with an initial thought (thoughtNumber = 1)
    2. Continue adding thoughts sequentially
    3. You can revise previous thoughts if needed
    4. You can create branches to explore alternative paths
    
    ## Example
    
    ```python
    # First thought
    sequential_thinking(
        thought="First, we need to understand the problem requirements.",
        thoughtNumber=1,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True
    )
    
    # Second thought
    sequential_thinking(
        thought="Now, let's analyze the key constraints.",
        thoughtNumber=2,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True
    )
    
    # Revise a thought
    sequential_thinking(
        thought="Actually, we need to clarify the problem requirements first.",
        thoughtNumber=1,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True,
        isRevision=True,
        revisesThought=1
    )
    
    # Branch from thought 2
    sequential_thinking(
        thought="Let's explore an alternative approach.",
        thoughtNumber=3,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True,
        branchFromThought=2,
        branchId="alternative-approach"
    )
